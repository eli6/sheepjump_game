# Sheep Jump Game :sheep: :joystick:

Small Godot game experiment that I wrote in 2019 (still a stub) that involves a sheep jumping on rocks in outer space :ringed_planet:, collecting clover :four_leaf_clover:. To be continued some day.

## Installation

You need to have the Godot engine installed. Clone the project, open the "project.godot" file with the Godot game engine and press play to try out the game.
